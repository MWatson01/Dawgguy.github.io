                    Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is an action-adventure single-player
                    <sup>[1]</sup> video game played from a third-person 
                    perspective. As with the first game and Miles Morales, 
                    Peter Parker and Miles Morales are the two main characters, 
                    with Mary Jane and Venom<sup>[2]</sup> playable in certain 
                    missions, becoming individually playable in accordance 
                    with the story as they traverse an open world New York City 
                    and fight enemies.<sup>[3]</sup> Players can acquire new 
                    abilities and collect various Spider-Man suits. Peter and 
                    Miles can be freely swapped between at any point during 
                    free-roam in the game's open world, and have dedicated 
                    missions both in the main story and as part of side content 
                    that takes advantage of their individual traits.<sup>[4]</sup>
                     The game expands upon the prior entries' open world, 
                     allowing players to explore Brooklyn and Queens in 
                     addition to Manhattan, which was the main setting of 
                     the previous two games.<sup>[5]</sup>Building on the 
                     combat system of the previous titles, both Spider-Men are 
                     able to parry physical attacks, as certain enemy types are 
                     impervious to dodging. During traversal, both Peter and 
                     Miles's new suits come equipped with Web Wings, which, 
                     when deployed, allow them to glide across the city, 
                     with their speed and distance covered increasing when 
                     taking advantage of areas such as wind tunnels. Each 
                     Spider-Man's gadget wheel has been upgraded with 
                     additional equippable mods for their web-shooters, 
                     such as being able to cast a Web Line across pillars 
                     for additional footing during stealth sequences suspended 
                     above enemies, and the Web Grabber, allowing multiple 
                     enemies to be pulled into an isolated spot for Stealth 
                     Takedowns, which can be performed on two enemies at once. 
                     In addition to Peter Parker's standard gameplay, he is 
                     playable when bonded to the Venom symbiote, granting him 
                     tendrils that he can use in combat and unique web-based 
                     abilities.<sup>[6]</sup> Both Spider-Men have individual 
                     Skill Trees with additional unlockable abilities for both 
                     of them once they accumulate enough Skill Points in 
                     accordance with their experience level, as well as a 
                     third Skill Tree dedicated to shared abilities between 
                     them.<sup>[7]</sup><sup>[8]</sup>
